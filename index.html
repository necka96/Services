    <h2>Repair</h2>
    <p>Repairs often mean simple replacement of worn or used components intended to be periodically renewed by a home-owner, such as burnt out light bulbs, worn out batteries, or overfilled vacuum cleaner bags. Another class of home repairs relates to restoring something to a useful condition, such as sharpening tools or utensils, replacing leaky faucet washers, cleaning out plumbing traps, rain gutters. Because of the required precision, specialized tools, or hazards, some of these are best left to experts such as a plumber. One emergency repair that may be necessary in this area is overflowing toilets. Most of them have a shut-off valve on a pipe beneath or behind them so that the water supply can be turned off while repairs are made, either by removing a clog or repairing a broken mechanism.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the most perplexing repairs facing a home-owner are broken or damaged things. In today's era of built-in
    obsolescence for many products, it is often more convenient to replace something rather than attempt to repair it. A
    repairman is faced with the tasks of accurately identifying the problem, then finding the materials, supplies, tools and
    skills necessary to sufficiently effect the repair. Some things, such as broken windows, appliances or furniture can be
    carried to a repair shop, but there are many repairs that can be performed easily enough, such as patching holes in
    plaster and drywall, cleaning stains, repairing cracked windows and their screens, or replacing a broken electrical
    switch or outlet. Other repairs may have some urgency, such as broken water pipes, broken doors, latches or windows, or
    a leaky roof or water tank, and this factor can certainly justify calling for professional help. A home handyman may
    become adept at dealing with such immediate repairs, to avoid further damage or loss, until a professional can be
    summoned.</p>
